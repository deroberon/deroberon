### Did you said Games? 
Yes, I like to play and sometimes code games also.

### Did you said Stable Diffusion? 
Yes, I'm in!! I like to express myself through generated AI art. As a SD environment I love the freedom that Comfyui give me to get the exactly result I want node by node. And if I don't find one, I can always code my own.
